# Input file 

It contains a file called parameter.h when the parameters of the simulation must be introduced.

* **nc**: Number of particles per side.
* **density**: The density of the system.
* **strucutre**: It is used to choose which initial structure implement. For SC:1, for fcc:2, for diamond 3.
* **temp**: Temperature of the system
* **vel_opt**: If is 1, the initial velocities are generated by a bimodal distribution. Else, initial velocities are 0.
* **ntimes**: All the steps of the simulation.
* **everyt**: Print thermodynamics data every **everyt** time steps.
* **dt**: timestep.
