## About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

Python is used for the results plotting and representation. A python version higher or equal than `python 3.6` is needed, and additionally the following libraries are needed:

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

To install these libraries, the python package manager `pip` can be used. The required versions are available from the included [requirements.txt](src/requirements.txt) file and can be easily installed using the following command while in the same directory:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
`pip` can normally be installed from your distribution package manager.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
